# TDF - Timeline Data Format
#
# The file is xml file format that is designed to store time-series of data for medical 
# applications. All Elements have close tags, and comments are standard XML comments.
#
# To read a TDF file, we typically iterate at several levels:
#   For each partition in the file
#       For each timeline in the partition
#           For each data entry in the current timeline
#
# You do not have to iterate over partitions, so you can instead just iterate over
#   all timelines in the file. However, this allows you to have different worker processes
#   for a single file, and so avoid Python memory growth. That is important, because on very
#   large files, Python's heap can grow to consume all virtual memory and crash the process.

#     This element describes one or more events that happened at a time.
#     The events are a comma-separated list of words in the text of the element.
#  Attributes:
#      T="ttt" is the timestamp for when the event happened
#      C = className where className is described in TDFMedicineValues
#      V = value   where value is described in TDFMedicineValues
#      P = Priority. This is only used for RadImg
#      D - Detail 
#  Optional Attributes - These may be included in some Events of class "Admit"
#       DiedThisAdmission = T/F  Died During the Admission
#       DiedIn12Mos = T/F
#       Readmit30D = T/F Readmit In 30 Days
#
#  <OC scope=xxx>  name=value, name=value, name=value   </OC>
#       OC is short for "Outcomes" and this element contains a text list of outcomes either during 
#       a single timeline or for the the current event
#       If the scope attribute is "Admit" then this applies just to the admission
#       If the scope attribute is "All" then this applies to the timeline
#
#       In the text contents, name is one of:
#           DiedThisAdmission - The value is "T" or "F". Died During the Admission
#           DiedIn12Mos - The value is "T" or "F"

#   This element contains all data that is sampled at a single time.
#   An example is a Basic Metabolic Panel, which has 7 lab values, and all are
#   drawn from the same blood sample at the same time.    
#   The data values are stored as a text string of name=value pairs.
#             Na=131,K=3.7
#  Attributes:
#      T="ttt" is the timestamp for when the event happened
#
#      C = className  where className is one of:
#           L - Labs
#           V - Vitals
#           D - Diagnoses
#
#       O = options which is a set of options flags. For diagnoses, this is 0 or 1 which
#           means whether the value was present on admission
#
#       V - A series of name value pairs, in the form:
#           name1=val1,name2=valw,name3=val3
#           The values are numbers except in a few specific cases below.
#
#       The time category when an event will happen. 
#       This includes events that never happen, because it assigns a special category to that.
#
#  <M T=xxxx diag=value>
#  This is a medication.
#  Attributes:
#      T="ttt" is the timestamp for when the event happened
#      C = medType, which is one of the following:
#         IRx - This is an inpatient prescription. The date is when it was ordered, so it starts after this date.
#         HRx - This is a home prescription. The date is when it was ordered, so it starts after this date.
#         Rec - This is an inpatient med-rec, which is when it was reconciled. The date is the time of the med-rec, so the med was given up tp this date.
#         Mar - This is an inpatient administration, recorded in the MAR.
#         Blood - This is a transfusion
#      ST="ttt" this is a stop time. This is usually unreliable. Some hospitals set an arbitrary
#         stop time, like 1 year from start, to indicate a med that continues until it is explicitly discontinued.
#
#   The body of the element is a list of medications.
#           med1,med2,med3,......,medn
#   Where each med is a tuple string:
#       drugName:dose:doseRoute:dosesPerDay
#       Dose is a floating point number, like 12.5 or 50    
#           The units of the dose string are implied by the med, but are usually mg.
#       The dose route is:
#           i - IV
#           o - oral
#           t - topical
#       The dosesPerDay is an integer. It is assumed doses are spread out evenly over the day, so 
#       for example, 2 doses per day would imply Q12h.
#
#
#  <Text T=ttt C=nnn>  some-text   </Text>
#  Parent Element: TL
#  Child Elements: None
#  Text Contents:
#     This is a free text note or report 
#  Attributes:
#      T="ttt" is the timestamp for when the procedure was reported.
#      C="nnn" where nnn is one of:

# TimeStamps are a formatted string that is the time code. Each TimeStamp has the
# format:   
#          dd:hh:mm
# or:
#          dd:hh:mm:ss
#
# where:
#   dd is the number of days. 
#       The number may be positive or negative depending on whether the timecode
#       is before or after the indexEvent of the timeline.
#   hh is the number of hours. 
#   mm is the number of minutes. 
#   ss is the number of seconds. This is optional and not used for medical data.
#
# All numbers are 2 or more digits. They are padded with a leading 0 if the 
# number is < 10.
#
# Days are the day in your lifetime, so 365 is the 1st birthday, 3650 is the tenth birthday and
# 36500 is the 100th birthday. This representation has several advantages:
# 1. It is deidentified. It has no relation to the calendar date
# 2. It is easy to compute time intervals, like whether 2 dates are within 30 days of each other.
# 3. The same timestamp tells you when something happened in relation to all other events, and also
#   exactly how old the patient is at each event.
#
##########################################
#
# The Reader API allows clients to iterate over timelines and read values
# for a timeline. A client may specify criteria that restricts data to specific sections.
# Some example criteria for medical data include:
#     - Values while a patient is in the hospital only
#     - Everything between admission and discharge to the hospital
#     - All events between a surgery and discharge. This looks at post-operative complications.
#     - All events between dialysis and 1 day later. This looks at post-dialysis complications.
